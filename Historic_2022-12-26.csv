We waited 45 minutes for our main meal to even reach us, Bolognese was watery, the fungi mushroom pasta looked and tasted revolting. Don' even mention the deserts/ the brownie was gritty and powdery, the tiramisu was gritty anf left an awful residue in your mouth and the cookie with ice cream you couldn' even cut the cookie it was so hard. Don' eat here! Care to mention we didn' get one smile from any of the waiters! Poor service and food was awful!","April 2022",""

The restaurant was busy, and extremely loud - a lack of soft furnishings and the acoustics of the restaurant served like an echo chamber and we had to yell across the table to hear each...other. Two of us ordered pizza, and unfortunately it was very oily and greasy, not to the standard of a usual Bella Italia venue. - we have had the same experience before Christmas when we visited and had hoped it was a one-off, sadly it appears not. Other dishes were very tasty, so it's just the pizza that appears to need some attention. I must compliment the staff, they were lovely, polite and attentive, and the gelato sandwich we shared for a pudding was beautiful, so there was plenty of good stuff to mention. Unfortunately the pizza - which is obviously a staple of this type of restaurant - did let the evening down to the extent that we wouldn't be able to recommend the restaurant, a good pizza restaurant using a quality pizza oven should not be getting this wrong!","February 2022","Dover, United Kingdom"
