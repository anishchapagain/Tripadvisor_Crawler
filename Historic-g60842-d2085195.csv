I don't know enough about pizza to be a snob but it was pretty much what I expect from pizza. A few in my party said the crust/bread was excellent. Unfortunately, we didn't try anything other than pizza though I do believe cost would have become a factor for me.

The best parts...indoors bathroom for customers was cool and clean. And the gal who waited on us was definitely above average. Not in a touristy way, but in the she's-actually-decent-at-her job kinda way. Wish I'd gotten her name to give her praise.","June 2022",""

Save the cheese dip from the bread for the pizza crust. It was just the right amount of Crispy and Chewy and very tasty.

Service was...eh...waitress was sweet, new, and there was a language barrier but she really tried and did a good job at it. Host kept trying to sit us outside...who eats pizza outside when it's 90 degrees? They didn't seem thrilled that we didn't want to eat outside.

The Mellow Mushroom is the place to go. The Gatlinburg location isn't the most ""attractive"" of the chain's locations but met our expectations in terms of a much-anticipated sausage and mushroom pizza. (We live in the Midwest and always look forward to finding a Mellow Mushroom during our southern travels.)","March 2022","Michigan"

I ordered a house special pizza to go. After having the house special pizza at the mellow mushroom Lexington, KY location where the pizza was absolutely the best pizza I've ever eaten. We leave and go to our cabin.My disappointment after opening the box and seeing a pizza that looked like a frozen store brand pizza at your local grocery store. The toppings were sparce with very little cheese, nothing at all like we get at the Lexingtonlocation. I guess the mellow mushroom in Gatlinburg is just another tourist trap. I'll go to the best Italian Cafe and Pizzeria where I know the pizza is outstanding.","March 2022","Bardstown, Kentucky"

You can overlook the parkway while you enjoy a great pizza with numerous drink options. Our waiter knew his stuff and offered several recommendations upon our asking.","January 2022","Lawrenceburg, Kentucky"
